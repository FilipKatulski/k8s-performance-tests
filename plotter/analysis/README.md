# Jupyter notebook data analysis

Go and it's packages despite being fast can only produce static images. To overcome this problem I have developed a Pythonic solution with Jupyter Lab. 

This Jupyter notebook uses Plotly to demonstrate test data in an interactive way on a single document. 

It's interactive features include:
- data selection
- zooming
- displaying statistics
- grid manipulation 

Every possible function is described within the notebook.
